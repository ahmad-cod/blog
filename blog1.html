                    A <b>Blog</b> is useful for many reasons. It can become a source of leads, it can be the place
                    where,
                    in the future, you might sell your products,
                    or it can simply be the place where you have your audience and express your ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are my thoughts on blogging, why I think every developer should blog, and blog consistently.
                </p><br>
                <h4 style="color: #19b16c;">A few things I want you to forget</h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                   1. <b>“I am not an expert”</b><br>
                    Anyone has a unique angle, a perspective on something that’s worth sharing. You might think you
                    don’t know as much as person X, but person Y might have much less experience than you and would
                    benefit from reading your thoughts and learnings.

                    Also, the best moment to teach something is right after you’ve learned it, because you remember how
                    not knowing about it feels.

                    In this case, you can blog with the tone of a student that’s just learned something. I learn new
                    things every day. Around 50% of what I end up writing I just learned while researching a topic.
                </p>
                <p>
                   2. <b>“I’m not a good writer”</b><br>
                    I’m not too, but I don’t care.
                    Just remember: you will never become a good writer unless you practice writing every day for years.
                    You will become a good writer, eventually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  3.  <b>“I fear criticism”</b> <br>
                    It’s true that some places on the internet are not afraid to give harsh opinions on things,
                    notoriously Reddit and Hacker News — but this is a good thing.

                    Remember, you’re not growing if you’re not challenged. Also, you’re not required to post there if
                    you don’t want to. Do you worry about someone making a mean comment on a post that’s controversial?
                    Remove comments altogether.
                </p>
